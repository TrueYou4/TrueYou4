  <main>
    <p>Welcome to TrueYou. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the TrueYou mobile application (the "App"), developed by Bazil Sanderson and Owen [Last Name] ("We", "Us", "Our"). By using or accessing the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Purpose and Early Access Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>TrueYou is currently in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage and is provided to early testers for feedback and evaluation purposes. As such, the App may contain bugs, incomplete features, or security vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>By using the App, you understand and accept that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The App may not function reliably at all times.</li>
      <li>Data loss, interruption, or errors may occur.</li>
      <li>Privacy or security issues may not be fully addressed.</li>
      <li>You use the App at your own risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>To use TrueYou, you must be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required in your country. If you are underage, you must have permission from a parent or guardian.</p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activities under your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App uses Firebase (a Google service) to store user data, including but not limited to names, email addresses, photos, location check-ins, and messages. We take reasonable precautions to protect your data, but we cannot guarantee its security.</p>
    <p>See our <a href="https://trueyou.pro/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more details on how we collect and use your information.</p>

    <h2>5. Location-Based Features</h2>
    <p>The App uses GPS and location data to provide features such as location logging, badges, and map-based interactions. You are responsible for ensuring you have the appropriate permissions enabled, and you agree to use these features lawfully and respectfully.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All code, designs, text, trademarks, and other content in the App are the exclusive property of Bazil Sanderson and Owen [Last Name], unless otherwise noted. You may not copy, reproduce, reverse engineer, or distribute any part of the App without our explicit written permission.</p>

    <h2>7. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>The App is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” We make no warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the App’s performance, security, reliability, or fitness for any purpose.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or related to your use of the App. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, loss of access, emotional distress, or exposure to inappropriate content due to user behavior.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties.</p>

    <h2>10. Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms at any time. If we do, we’ll post the updated version on our website or in-app, and your continued use of the App means you accept the revised Terms.</p>
